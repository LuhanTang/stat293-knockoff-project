# STAT 293 Final Project: Model-X Knockoffs vs. Benjamini–Hochberg

This repository contains the code and results for the STAT 293 Final Project, 
which evaluates the performance of **Model-X Knockoff+** for feature selection 
and compares it against the classical **Benjamini–Hochberg (BH)** procedure.

The project studies empirical FDR control and statistical power under three 
high-dimensional data-generating models.
